## The Story behind Serv

Waiting isn't fun. Whether we're waiting at a restaurant for a table or renewing our driver's license, too much of time is wasted in the waiting room. We wanted to streamline the waiting process by putting the power of responsibility in the customer's hands, where they can enter lines and go complete other tasks without being bogged down by the distance restraints of restaurant buzzers or the monotonous voice leading customers to a representative at an ICBC. Serv helps us realize the amount of time spent waiting while also empowering businesses with customer capacity visuals for improved management of employees and business efficiency.

## Overview
Let's get rid of the line and help get you back your time. Introducing **Serv**: reducing wait times by automatically queuing customers with a single tap of their phone, and alerting them when their provider is ready to see them. Being easy to implement and use, Serv is the perfect solution for managing queues in clinics, restaurants, banks, and more.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Can I be in two lines at once?**

No, being in two lines at once could prevent other users from quickly receiving their desired service.

**Could someone reprogram the NFC tags used?**

Reprogramming the NFC tag requires a password that's only available to the merchant upon request.

**What happens if my phone is dead?**

We encourage merchants to keep the traditional waiting line in place for the few occasions where Serv may not be easily accessible. Merchants can manage queues using Serv's built-in vacancy manager based on the number of people resorting to the traditional waiting line.

**What if I don't have any mobile data left on my phone?**

Connect to the merchant's wifi! In order for merchants to partner with us, we require that they provide some form of accessible internet connection to their customers.

**What if I decide I want to leave the queue?**

Serv provides a "leave" option to give users the ability to leave the queue without holding up the line for other customers.

**How much time do I have to claim my spot in line?**

Users are given 5 minutes to claim their invitation before they are removed from the line.
